# Introducing ssmes (School of Science and Math Exam Scheduler)
This exam scheduler is the result of a NCSSM Mini-Term 2019 project intended to help the school reduce exam conflicts. The final solution of the Mini-Term was to have only two exam blocks each day so as to avoid conflicts in which students would have three exams within a 24 hour period. Thus, this scheduler reduces the number of exam conflicts where students have more than one exam in a single exam block.
